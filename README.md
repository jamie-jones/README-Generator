## INSTALLATION

## USAGE

As the title says, this is a README generator that will generate the prompts that you need to fill out in order to have a complete README.md

## CONTRIBUTING

I want to thank the other classmates from the Boot Camp, who once again, as we always do, came together to work as a team, answer questions anyone else had, and helped however they could!

## TESTS

It's simple. Once you open it up, it will prompt you with questions that you only need to answer until the very end. After that, it will generate the README and create a Markdown file for you!
